Basic Idea: Users should be able to create a team and set available times, and then a match (best of 3) should be emailed to them when available.

Users can list their alts under there account
Users can belong to multiple teams
Users select available times (hour blocks probably, half hour at smallest), all separate times jammed into big table
Look for collisions with 3 hours gap (enough for 3 games, because best of 3)
Store some data about completed matches
Verify league name by naming rune page/mastery page and checking API


Problems:
League Names may change ownership. Not sure how to account here unless Riot provides a unique id of some sort
